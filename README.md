I enjoy [writing!](https://cynthiapeter.com/series/technical-writing-basics). Writing gives me an opportunity to learn and share my experiences with people. 

I love to hold the door open to new learners. I'll say writing is my super power💪🏿 But then, I have other superpowers, like amazing problem-solving skills, brainstorming, research, a remarkable human relationship skills, and a good sense of humor. You definitely want me on your team, I mean who doesn't need a good laugh? 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️.

I Currently contribute to open source projects like [Atsign](https://atsign.com/), where we are commited to making the internet a more human place, where privacy is a fundamental right, and everyone owns their data.

I strive to be better by learning, reading, and building healthy relationships. I don't have it all figured out. However, in my quest to find where I shine the brightest, I'll learn as I go and bet better.
