---

I enjoy writing. Writing allows me to learn from and share my experiences with others, which is why I love open-source projects.

I love to hold the door open for new learners. I'll say writing is my superpower 💪🏿, but I also possess other superpowers, such as exceptional problem-solving, brainstorming, research, remarkable human relationship skills, and a good sense of humor. Would you like me to be on your team? I mean, who doesn't need a good laugh? 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️.

I currently contribute to open-source projects, such as [IgboAPI](https://igboapi.com/) and the [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), as an Open-Source Software (OSS) Writer.

I strive to improve by learning, reading, and building healthy relationships.
