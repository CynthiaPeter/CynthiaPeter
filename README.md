Hi there! Now you're here, I have a confession to make. I love to code and solve problems, but I enjoy writing more!

I love to teach kids and anyone that's new to tech. I love to hold the door open to new learners. I'll say writing is my super power💪🏿 But then, I have other superpowers, like amazing problem-solving skills, brainstorming, research, a remarkable human relationship skills, and a good sense of humor. You definitely want me on your team, I mean who doesn't need a good laugh? 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️.

I am a mobile app developer using flutter and dart. And in my flutter journey, I've had enough bugs to last me a lifetime😁 and that's enough to tell me that I should give up. But I ain't. I will keep learning to code because the little things I learn allows me to write and share with newbies and wannabees. I plan to keep writing so there's no stopping.

I look forward to collaborate with flutter developers to build some really interesting projects  I have in my diary. I also look forward to contributing to open source projects either as a developer or a writer.  
You can reach out to me on twitter @iamCynthiaPeter or send an email.💙

In the future, I'll love to spend at least a day with the flutter team @ Google😎. Either as a developer, a technical writer, or just some random visitor.
