I enjoy [writing!](https://cynthiapeter.com/series/technical-writing-basics). Writing allows me to learn and share my experiences with people. I Love Open source projects.

I love to hold the door open to new learners. I'll say writing is my superpower 💪🏿 But then, I have other superpowers, like amazing problem-solving, brainstorming, research, remarkable human relationship skills, and a good sense of humour. Do you want me on your team? I mean, who doesn't need a good laugh? 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️.

I currently contribute to open-source projects like [IgboAPI](https://igboapi.com/) and [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), as an OSS Writer.

I strive to improve by learning, reading, and building healthy relationships.
